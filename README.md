# Mini Arcade Cabinet
Ever wanted to play a game on your own miniature arcade cabinet? This repo contains all the code, schematics, and stl files needed to create your very own mini arcade machine running on an ATTiny85 microcontroller with an Arduino bootloader.

## Required materials:
* 1x DIP8 ATTiny85 microcontroller
* 1x Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller that can be used as an ISP
* 1x 3D Printer with filament of your choosing (if you don't have one many places such as local libraries have printers you can temporarily use)
* 1x Red LED
* 1x Green LED
* 1x Blue LED
* 1x Yellow LED
* 1-2 Feet of 22 AWG solid core wire or ~10x jumper wires
* 4x 6mm Push Buttons
* 1x 170 Tie Point breadboard or 1x Perf Board (one that fits into the arcade cabinet is best)
* 1x Small Perf Board (This is for the buttons, you will probably need to cut it down to size)
* 4x Through Hole Schottky Diodes
* 4x 220 or 330 Ohm Resistors (Choose depending on desired brightness of LEDs)
